# Conclusion

This project had several goals. On the first hand, to create our own synchronous data
flow language. Secondly, to explore what could be achieved in terms of game programming
using this newfound tool.

At the end of the period alloted to the project, we do have a working compiler, albeit not
complete. Normalization, scheduling, intermediate code generation and Javascript generation
are both complete and working. However, features are lacking in the SMUDGE compiler, as described
in the section Future Work. As such, exploration of gameplay programming space could not be
achieved. However, it should be noted that we achieved programming the game `Snake` in our
language.

On a more personal note, this project has been a huge opportunity to both learn a new language -
`Ocaml` - and the world of language design and implementaion. This also has been a way
to familiarize with the marathonic and in-depth work of the research world. I would espacially like to thanks Mr. Dagand for all the time and help he dedicated, as well as anonymous reviewers.
