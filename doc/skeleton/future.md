# Future Work

As of now, type and clock correctness are burdens placed
on the programmer. Our next revision should include type inference
and checking, as well as clock inference and checking based on the semantics
given in [\ref{Pouzet}]. This change should remove programmer's abilitied
to use custom operators in synchronous code.
